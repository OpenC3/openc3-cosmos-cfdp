# OpenC3 COSMOS CFDP Plugin

This plugin provides a microservice and corresponding API for handling the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).

This CFDP implementation is intended to be compliant with:

- CCSDS 727.0-B-5 - Blue Book July 2020
- CCSDS 727.0-B-4 - Blue Book January 2007
- CCSDS 727.0-B-3 - Blue Book June 2005

It is also potentially compliant with earlier versions but that has not been evaluated.

## Installation

1. Install this plugin in the Admin Tool
2. During installation, edit plugin.txt to configure all of your MIB settings (See MIB Configuration Below)

In particular be sure to set the desired protocol_version_number for each remote entity. protocol_version_number 0 is used for all versions of the standard before the 2020 release. protocol_version_number 1 is used for the current release and potential future releases. This plugin defaults to using protocol_version_number 1.

## Usage in Scripts

See: [cfdp.rb](./lib/cfdp.rb)

```
require 'cfdp'

# Send a file and wait up to 10 minutes for complete (Default mode)
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin")

# Force UNACKNOWLEDGED mode
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin", transmission_mode: "UNACKNOWLEDGED")

# Force UNACKNOWLEDGED mode and request closure
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin", transmission_mode: "UNACKNOWLEDGED", closure_requested: "CLOSURE_REQUESTED")

# Force ACKNOWLEDGED mode
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin", transmission_mode: "ACKNOWLEDGED")

# Send a file and don't wait
continuation = cfdp_subscribe()
transaction_id = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin", timeout: nil)
...

...
indication = cfdp_indications(transaction_id: transaction_id, indication_type: 'Transaction-Finished', continuation: continuation)

# Cancel a transaction
indication = cfdp_cancel(transaction_id: transaction_id)

# Suspend a transaction
indication = cfdp_suspend(transaction_id: transaction_id)

# Resume a suspended transaction
indication = cfdp_resume(transaction_id: transaction_id)

# Get a report on a transaction
indication = cfdp_report(transaction_id: transaction_id)
puts indication["status_report"]

# Get a list of transactions
transactions = cfdp_transactions(active: true)

# Filestore requests
requests = []
requests << ["CREATE_FILE", file_name]
requests << ["DELETE_FILE", file_name]
requests << ["RENAME_FILE", old_file_name, new_file_name]
requests << ["APPEND_FILE", file_name, appended_file_name]
requests << ["REPLACE_FILE", replaced_file_name, contents_file_name]
requests << ["CREATE_DIRECTORY", directory_name]
requests << ["REMOVE_DIRECTORY", directory_name]
requests << ["DENY_FILE", file_name]
requests << ["DENY_DIRECTORY", directory_name]
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(destination_entity_id: 1, filestore_requests: requests)
indication["filestore_responses"].each do |response|
  puts "Filestore failed: #{response}" if response["STATUS_CODE"] != "SUCCESSFUL"
end

# Proxy operations
# These add remote_entity_id to specify a remote entity

# Get a file (using proxy put) and wait for it to be received
remote_entity_id = 1
my_entity_id = 2
transaction_id, indication = cfdp_put(remote_entity_id: remote_entity_id, destination_entity_id: my_entity_id, source_file_name: "file_to_send.bin", destination_file_name: "received_file.bin")

# Cancel a proxy put transaction
indication = cfdp_cancel(transaction_id: transaction_id, remote_entity_id: 1)

# Suspend a remote transaction
indication = cfdp_suspend(transaction_id: transaction_id, remote_entity_id: 1)

# Resume a remote transaction
indication = cfdp_resume(transaction_id: transaction_id, remote_entity_id: 1)

# Get a status report on a remote transaction
indication = cfdp_report(transaction_id: transaction_id, remote_entity_id: 1, report_file_name: "my_report.txt")

# Get a remote directory listing
indications = cfdp_directory_listing(remote_entity_id: 1, directory_name: "/files", directory_file_name: "my_listing.txt")

```

## MIB Configuration

The CFDP Management Information Base (MIB) is configured by passing options to the CFDP microservice in plugin.txt. See the local [plugin.txt](plugin.txt), for example:

    MICROSERVICE CFDP CFDP
      ...
      # MIB Options Follow - Modify for your CFDP implementation!
      OPTION root_path /DEFAULT/targets_modified/CFDP/tmp
      OPTION bucket config

The MIB Options will always need to be configured for your CFDP implementation and mission. The [plugin.txt](plugin.txt) is an example which includes a test implementation. This can be edited on installation in COSMOS (click the plugin.txt tab) but can also be edited and built locally.

Most settings are associated with the most recently mentioned source_entity_id or destination_entity_id.

Minimum required settings:

- A source_entity_id and corresponding tlm_info must be given.
- At least one destination_entity_id must be defined with a corresponding cmd_info.
- root_path must be defined
- bucket should be set if the root_path is in a bucket. Otherwise the root path is assumed to be a mounted volume.

### Source Entity Configuration

These settings are applied to the CFDP microservice via `OPTION <name> <value>` in the [plugin.txt](plugin.txt). Source Entity Configuration options generally apply to the COSMOS side of the transaction.

### Remote Entity Configuration

These settings are applied to the CFDP microservice via `OPTION <name> <value>` in the [plugin.txt](plugin.txt). Remote Entity Configuration options generally apply to the target side (Bus or Payload Flight Software) of the transaction.
